</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I spend a lot of my time in terminals.</p>
<p>That's probably a bit of an understatement. Really, basically all of my time on a computer is spent either in a browser, in a videogame or in a terminal. I like text-based interfaces, and I still don't know why I would use the emacs GUI.</p>
<p>So it probably won't be a surprise that I think our terminals are kinda... bad. Here's a few reasons why:</p>
<div class="section" id="arbitrary-limitations">
<h2>Arbitrary limitations</h2>
<p>Ever wondered why you can't bind Control+I separately from tab?</p>
<p>Well, the reason for that is ASCII. &quot;I&quot; is 73 (0x49), the tab character is 9 (0x09), and applying a control modifier masks off the upper 3 bits, so 73 - 64 = 9.
That means, as far as the application is concerned, there is no way to tell tab from Control+I. It is the same thing.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is no such thing as an &quot;alt&quot; key. There might be on your keyboard, but as far as your terminal is concerned it's really a fancy way of saying &quot;escape&quot;. Pressing alt+e will send the escape character quickly followed by the &quot;e&quot; character. The way applications handle this is to wait for a bit after seeing an escape character to determine if it was an escape key that was pressed or an escape sequence.</p>
<p>This is one of the many many arbitrary limitations that our current terminals have that just aren't intrinsic to the text-based paradigm. There is no reason this needs to be that way, except that somebody in the 70s made it so and nobody has managed to change it.</p>
<p>Of course you could make a terminal that improves on this, but:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terminal-inconsistencies">
<h2>Terminal inconsistencies</h2>
<p>There are a lot of terminals, and a lot of variety in what they support and how they behave.</p>
<p>Some common differences:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How many colors does it support?</li>
<li>What escape sequences does it send for which keys?</li>
<li>What optional features does it support? Can I send my PWD to it? Does it show a title?</li>
<li>Does it reflow text on its own? VTE and iTerm do, konsole doesn't</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, many of these differences just seem entirely pointless. Why does this send <tt class="docutils literal">\x7f</tt> for my backspace key while that sends <tt class="docutils literal">\b</tt> (the actual backspace character)? There is an answer, but it's a historical one rather than a technical one.</p>
<p>Another example: Konsole and iTerm both support cursor shaping (which is useful e.g. for vi-mode - make your cursor a block in normal mode and a <tt class="docutils literal">|</tt> bar in insert mode). The sequences, as far as I can tell, work exactly the same <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id1">[1]</a>, but one uses <tt class="docutils literal">\e]50;CursorShape=0\x7</tt>, while the other uses <tt class="docutils literal">\e]1337;CursorShape=0\x7</tt>. See the difference? Yeah, that's a &quot;1337&quot; in place of a &quot;50&quot;. Cute. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
<p>But hey, you can surely detect these small differences automatically, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="detection-sucks">
<h2>Detection sucks</h2>
<p>Hahaha, no.</p>
<p>The primary way to detect what terminal your user is using and what it can do is $TERM, which is an environment variable that explains the type of terminal. You're supposed to use it to look at the actual terminal description in a thing called &quot;terminfo&quot;. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Only terminfo is basically broken.</p>
<p>Why? Well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You need the actual files installed to be able to look it up, which means your OS needs to provide them</li>
<li>People connect to servers via ssh, which just sends the $TERM value along, so all software running on that server will have to look up the terminfo for the terminal running on the (typically much newer) client, and if they don't find it they will fail to see anything and might even crash.</li>
<li>Adding a new terminfo entry is possible, but with LTS distributions there's a <em>looong</em> lag. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id4">[4]</a></li>
<li>Some (arguably badly written) software just hardcodes a few $TERM values it knows, mostly &quot;xterm*&quot;. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id5">[5]</a></li>
<li>The most used terminals are, for the most part, basically xterm-compatible-ish</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, almost every terminal claims to be some form of &quot;xterm&quot; - most often <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xterm-256color</span></tt>. Some people claim that this is wrong and you should simply configure the terminal to use its own terminfo entry (<a class="reference external" href="http://jdebp.uk./Softwares/nosh/guide/commands/TERM.xml">e.g.</a>). I can't agree - that just makes ssh'ing awkward, breaks programs and, most importantly, would require me to tell users to reconfigure their terminal.</p>
<p>Which means, if I want to distinguish gnome-terminal from konsole, I need to look elsewhere - both claim to be xterm-256color by default.</p>
<p>But at least I can use terminfo as a baseline, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terminfo-is-woefully-incomplete-or-wrong">
<h2>Terminfo is woefully incomplete or wrong</h2>
<p>Remember that <tt class="docutils literal">CursorShape</tt> sequence from above? There <em>is</em> an entry in terminfo for that, by the wonderfully descriptive name of &quot;DECSCUSR&quot; or &quot;Ss&quot; for short</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> infocmp -x <span class="o">|</span> grep -o <span class="s1">&#39;Ss=.*&#39;</span>
<span class="nv">Ss</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="se">\E</span><span class="o">[</span>%p1%d q,
</pre></div>
<p>..but it uses the actual xterm value of <tt class="docutils literal">\e[something q</tt>, not the konsole or iTerm value of <tt class="docutils literal">\e]50/1337something</tt>.</p>
<p>And even if it did, you still couldn't use it, because macOS' terminfo is old and crusty and doesn't have Ss, at all.</p>
<p>Of course when I say &quot;wrong&quot; here, it's not that I'm blaming the terminfo for not matching up to a terminal it's never been written for. I'm just saying that the terminfo is, from the application's perspective, wrong. It says things that simply aren't correct. I'm not interested in finding someone to blame, I'm interested in things being broken.</p>
<p>Or consider the sequence to communicate the current directory to the terminal. As far as I can tell, that one is <em>actually defined</em> as being &quot;OSC 7&quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id6">[6]</a>. OSC is an acronym and stands for <tt class="docutils literal">\e]</tt>. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id7">[7]</a></p>
<p>There is, as best as I can tell, no terminfo entry for it, and I'm really not expecting any.</p>
<p>What's more, the semantics for OSC 7 are weirdly complicated. Here's how fish handles it</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">printf</span> <span class="se">\e\]</span>7<span class="se">\;</span>file://%s%s<span class="se">\a</span> <span class="nv">$hostname</span> <span class="o">(</span>string escape --style<span class="o">=</span>url <span class="nv">$PWD</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So it starts with an escape, then a <tt class="docutils literal">]7;</tt>, then <em>a url to the current directory</em>. With actual URL-encoding. In a terminal. And then it ends with a bel character, just to make sure this wakes up anyone who uses a terminal that doesn't support it.</p>
<p>Or consider that it took <em>an actual literal decade</em> for terminfo to finally gain a way to say that a terminal supports 24-bit true color. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id8">[8]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-we-fix-it">
<h2>How do we fix it?</h2>
<p>So if we wanted to fix this, what would have to be done?</p>
<p>We would need standardization, and flexible standardization at that.</p>
<p>My preferred solution would be a mix of having an actual baseline of support combined with making optional features just ignored by the terminal if it doesn't want to support them.</p>
<p>For many things, the application doesn't really <em>care</em> if it necessarily ends up being used, it just wants to not break things. For example the cursor shaping sequence should either cause the cursor to be changed or nothing to happen, so the application can just fire and forget.</p>
<p>Or truecolor sequences should just be used basically everywhere, in the same format (the &quot;correct&quot; syntax uses colons, but most terminals support it with semicolons, some do both). If the terminal is incapable of rendering truecolor, let it pick the nearest color and use that instead.</p>
<p>Key escapes should just be the same everywhere, and there should be standardized sequences for expressing e.g. ctrl-i as a distinct keycombination from tab.</p>
<p>So a terminal would set $NU_TERM to true, and it would signal to the app that the baseline is safe to use. If the app wants to have ctrl-i encoded specially, it should send <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\e]666;to-the-future!\a</span></tt>, and everything should be grand and kittens will fall from the heavens (and safely land on their cute little feetsies, of course).</p>
<p>And people would have to stop using bad terminals.</p>
<p>I'm not holding my breath.</p>
