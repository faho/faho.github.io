</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>What's this blogging thing all about? Lemme check!</p>
<p>So, there's a recent addition to <a class="reference external" href="https://fishshell.com">fish</a> that I really like. It's called &quot;littlecheck&quot;, and it's a new test driver <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Now, test drivers are unlikely to ever really receive praise (or even be mentioned at all in most contexts), but they're surprisingly impactful. A bad test driver will leave you scratching your head if you have a failure, or will introduce friction to adding tests, which will make people not add tests.</p>
<p>For example, in our previous driver, each test consisted of three files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>test.in, the file to actually run.</li>
<li>test.out - the stdout of running test.in</li>
<li>test.err - the stderr</li>
</ul>
<p>Which had a few problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To create a new test, you need to create 3 files.</li>
<li>To figure out where a test failed, you need to follow 3 files at the same time</li>
<li>The &quot;.in&quot; is a fish script, but it can't be called &quot;.fish&quot; for internal reasons <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id2">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The replacement looks a little something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">#RUN: %fish %s</span>
<span class="k">echo</span> banana
<span class="c">#CHECK: banana</span>
date +%Y
<span class="c">#CHECK: 20{{\d+}}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Which immediately solves all the above issues (the files are indeed called &quot;something.fish&quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id3">[3]</a>), but also some I haven't even talked about yet.</p>
<p>See, we had an odd bug where redirecting to a directory (<tt class="docutils literal">echo something &gt; /directory/</tt>) didn't immediately fail. That's certainly something you'd like to test, and we did for quite a while. We just tested that redirecting to <cite>.</cite> failed with an error, and that was that. One file for the command, one file for the error and one file just because.</p>
<p>Fast forward 5 years to this January, when I was working on getting test suite to succeed on Solaris <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id4">[4]</a>. As it turns out Solaris also prints an error, but a different one (instead of &quot;Is a directory&quot; EISDIR you'd get &quot;Invalid argument&quot; EINVAL). The old test driver had no way to express this, and the error couldn't be redirected (because it's a syntax error), so this required us to disable the test. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Then we got another test driver (yes, that's two in parallel), which ran &quot;invocation tests&quot;, which checked how fish behaved when calling the binary with options. This was enough of an indirection that we managed to wedge in a way to use different test output depending on <cite>uname</cite>, so it worked again. But this required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A second test driver</li>
<li>Checking operating system based on _name_, not feature testing. Using <cite>uname</cite> should be avoided if at all possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what does littlecheck do here? See that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{{\d+}}</span></tt> above? That's an embedded regex that matches any string of digits, meaning that <tt class="docutils literal">date</tt> test will succeed as long as it's run in this century, or in about 18000 years <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id6">[6]</a>. Or, alternatively, you could use it for something useful like this actual test:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">#RUN: %fish %s</span>
<span class="k">begin</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> . <span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">status</span> -b<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;status -b returned true after bad redirect on a begin block&quot;</span>
<span class="c"># Note that we sometimes get fancy quotation marks here, so let&#39;s match three characters</span>
<span class="c">#CHECKERR: &lt;W&gt; fish: An error occurred while redirecting file {{...}}</span>
<span class="c">#CHECKERR: {{open: Is a directory|open: Invalid argument}}</span>
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$status</span>
<span class="c">#CHECK: 1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So you just embed the possibilities in a regex, and it'll just allow both. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Hopefully you'll see why I really like this (thanks ridiculousfish!), and I haven't even mentioned the cherries on top:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It's entirely fish-agnostic - this can run any scripting language (that uses <cite>#</cite> as a comment character)</li>
<li>It's one single python file, no further dependencies</li>
<li>It's public domain <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id8">[8]</a></li>
</ul>
