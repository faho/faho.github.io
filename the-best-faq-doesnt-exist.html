</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In fish &lt; 3.0, we've had a frequently asked question <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a> that adding bindings in your config.fish (the configuration file) didn't work.</p>
<p>You see, fish doesn't use the common &quot;readline&quot; library, but has its own input/output facilities, and to bind keys you'd just execute a <cite>bind</cite> command like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">bind</span> <span class="se">\c</span>g forward-word
<span class="nb">bind</span> <span class="se">\t</span> <span class="nb">complete</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And that works if you're doing it interactively, so you like the binding and add it to your config file, and restart fish and... the bindings are gone?</p>
<p>This was a pretty frequent question for us, and we'd always answer the same:</p>
<blockquote>
You can't add bindings in config.fish, you'll have to add them to a function called <cite>fish_user_key_bindings</cite>.</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this was a pretty fundamental decision that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We'd support an emacs-inspired &quot;default&quot; mode and a vi-inspired &quot;vi&quot; mode <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a></li>
<li>Switching between the two would leave you with the same bindings every time</li>
<li>Setting up the mode could be done by setting a variable, global or universal <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Because of all these, what we did was to load the bindings <em>after</em> reading the config file (because the variable could be set there), and because of the second, we'd <em>erase</em> all bindings whenever a binding mode was picked. The result was changes from the config file disappearing.</p>
<p>Now, fixing this took me quite a while, and the fix turns out to be surprisingly elegant and simple:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There are now &quot;preset&quot; and &quot;user&quot; bindings</li>
<li>Modes set up their bindings as preset bindings</li>
<li>Switching mode just erases the preset bindings</li>
</ul>
<p>That means if you tried out vi-mode and decide to go back, it just erases all the h/j/k/l and such bindings and leaves your custom stuff untouched.</p>
<p>This has the further advantage that you can now decide to remove a custom binding and it'll leave the preset.</p>
<p>But what's best about this is that I no longer have to answer the FAQ. It just simply stopped existing.</p>
